dirt
====
dirt is a somewhat generic Python module for oversight and tracking of remotely-executed jobs.

Users submit jobs via RPC, those are added to a database, tasks are doled out to remote execution hosts, and results are stored in the DB and presented via a web page.

Possible uses include distributed build testing and automated distributed data processing.
