Overview
--------

dirt is a Python and CouchDB application for oversight and tracking of remotely-executed jobs.

Users submit groups of tasks to perform on a data set (or whatever), those are added to a database, tasks are doled out to remote execution hosts, and results are stored in the DB and presented via a web page.

Possible uses include distributed build testing and automated distributed data processing.
